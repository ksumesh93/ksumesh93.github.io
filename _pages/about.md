I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Florida International University under the supervision of [Fahad Saeed](https://prof-s.github.io/). In my research, I explore novel accelerator architecture paradigms for compute intensive applications in machine learning, proteomics and genomics. 
I am particularly interested in designing heterogenous systems targeting FPGAs, GPUs, CPUs, and specialized hardware such as compute-in-memory technologies.

Prior to joining FIU, I finished my masters degree in Systems, Control and Signal Processing from University of Southampton under the supervision of [Christopher Freeman](https://ctfreeman.wordpress.com/). 

[comment]: <>In my masters thesis, I developed the control algorithm for a 6-DOF robotic arm to catch a thrown object using a kinect camera as a sensor. 
Apart from academics, I have also worked as an embedded software developer at Mentor Graphics Embedded Software Division (Now Siemens EDA). While I enjoy anything that remotely involves problem solving, I am particularly interested in 
low-level system design where I get to interact closely with the hardware architecture.
