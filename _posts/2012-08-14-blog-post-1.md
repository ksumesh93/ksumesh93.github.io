It was 2012, I had just started my 3rd semester in my Eelctrical Engineering degree. We were starting the very important course on Object Oriented Programming using C++ 
and I was happy that the instructor was going to be the same professor who taught us computer fundamentals in our first semester. It was his passion for teaching and explring 
new ideas, which inspired us to work full time on the semester project and really put our heart and soul into it. The instructor wanted us to develop a game using OOP for that 
course and he really believed that we would all do a great job. To further motivate us, he showed us videos on evolution of game development since 1970's starting with the 
classics such as super mario and dangerous dave. We were all free to choose the game of our liking, and people chose really ambitious ideas such as a rubics cube solver, 
8 ball pool, and chess. I chose scrabble. I used to play scrabble with my cousins during those days and somehow it really appealed me to implement a simple C++ enginge which 
played against and completely destroys human players. And I did spend countless number of hours trying to perfect every aspect of the game but I was only partially able to 
complete that project. Regardless of that, the professor arranged for an exhibition for us where we would be able to showcase our projects to the entire departments students
and other professors. It was extremely empowering and getting the live feedback from other students gave us a unique perspective to think about our ideas. I was never able to
do as much as I wished to do and this has been bugging me ever since. Now, after 9 years have passed, I want to pick that project up from where I left off and finish it as 
a personal debt that I owe to that project. In the sections that follow, I am going to find the old code for the scrabble game and see where I left it off and try to finish 
the game and give it a new life. 

Removing the dust

At first, I wasn't able to find the project code and that was a mini heart-attack for me but I realized that we had submitted the code and executable by sharing a link to 
the dropbox. I hopped in to my dropbox, account and I found the complete code. To my surprise, the code compiles and executes

But the game is almost non-playable as shown here, when I make a word using my given alphabets, the computer is supposed to respond but it doesn't.

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
